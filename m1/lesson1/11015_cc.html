<div id="poptext"><p>Hi.  My name’s Samantha.  Any time you see this icon on a page, select  it so that I can provide you some additional insight to the world of recruiting  at NRCS.  I’ll share examples, stories,  interesting facts about the agency that you can share with potential  employees, tips and tricks, or other pertinent details you’ll need to  know. </p>
  <p>Also, you’ll be asked  some questions periodically through these lessons that give you a chance to  type in what you think or what you’d say.   Then, you’ll see a response I prepared that you can compare your  answer to.  Good luck on your training!</p>
