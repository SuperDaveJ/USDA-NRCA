<p>In 1933, the Soil  Erosion Service began working with farmers in the Coon Creek watershed of  southwestern Wisconsin  to transform the square, eroding fields.   With Raymond H. Davis, Bennet performed demonstrations of soil  conservation techniques and provided farmers with seeds, equipment, and  planning assistance.</p>

<p>The soil conservation  work was made permanent in 1935 with the passage of PL74-46, which created the  Soil Conservation Services (SCS) within USDA.   SCS expanded its work to blanket the countryside through conservation  districts.  In 1937 and thereafter,  conservation districts could be organized and sign cooperative agreements with  USDA.  Eventually SCS established field  offices where personnel worked with landowners in the nearly 3000 conservation  districts.</p>

<p>In 1994, the SCS was  renamed the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to reflect the shift  the service’s mission had taken to encompass soil, water, plants, and animals.</p>
