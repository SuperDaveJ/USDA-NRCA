  <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m a Soil Conservationist with the National Resource Conservation  Service.  I spend my work days developing  conservation plans.  Our agency focuses  on many different efforts that preserve natural resources. I understand that  what I do makes a difference on the land.   That&rsquo;s what drives me - I like helping landowners reach their goals and  see the positive results of the conservation work that is done.  We have offices that serve every county in  all 50 states and also the US  territories in the Pacific Basin and the Caribbean.  You can have a great career, simply &ldquo;Helping  People help the land&rdquo;, and I hope you will take some time to learn more about  NRCS.</p>
  <p>It  was a pleasure meeting you! Take Care!</p></div>
