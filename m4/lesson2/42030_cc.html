  <p>Leave is an important  benefit to most potential applicants.  It  also tends to be an area in which the Federal government is more attractive  than working for the private sector!  Be  sure to have the Leave Job Aid handy when you go to recruiting events so you  can answer questions that potential applicants may have about the leave  policies of working for the Federal government.</p>
