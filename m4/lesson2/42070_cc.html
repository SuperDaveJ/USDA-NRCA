  <p>The Basic Benefit and Social Security parts of FERS  require you to pay your share each pay period.&nbsp; Your agency withholds the  cost of the Basic Benefit and Social Security from your pay as payroll  deductions.&nbsp; Your agency pays its part too.&nbsp; Then, after you retire,  you receive annuity payments each month for the rest of your life.</p>
  <p>Social Security and the TSP can go with you to  your next job if you leave the Federal government before retirement. &nbsp; </p>
