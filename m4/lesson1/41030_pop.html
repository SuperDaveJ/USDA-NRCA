The relationship generally requires a high degree of trust and openness between the mentor and protégé, as the protégé shares his or her goals and challenges with the mentor to provide focus for the relationship.  In turn, the mentor shares his or her experiences, knowledge, and advice with the protégé in order to support the protégé's individual development.</p><p>Participation in NRCS Mentoring is encouraged by leadership and open to all employees.</p>";
