<p class="popupTitle">STEP Employee</p>
<div id="poptext"><p>I’m Edwin Martinez.  I’m currently working fulltime as a District  Conservationist in Clinton County, Michigan and working part-time on my doctoral degree at Michigan State University.  I was initially hired through the Student Career Experience Program in 2005  while I was finishing my graduate degree at the University of Puerto Rico.  I was introduced to the NRCS during a national recruiting effort in the fall of  2005.  The recruiting experience opened  my eyes to the work this great agency does and allowed me to learn about all  the opportunities available nationwide.</p>
<p>Conservation of natural resources was my passion  and finding an opportunity with the NRCS was one of my priority student goals.  In 2005 I achieved this milestone when I received the opportunity to work in North Platte, Nebraska  during the summer as a Soil Conservationist Student Trainee. I had the  opportunity to finish the 640 hours required by the SCEP program in the Utuado,  PR field office.</p>
<p>Once I completed my degree I was hired as a  permanent employee and started my career as a Soil Conservationist in Tulelake, California  where I received excellent training opportunities and completed several details  working under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program in multiple locations  within California.  I worked in the San Bernardino and San Diego counties,  assisting with conservation planning before and after fire emergencies.</p>
<p>The SCEP program was a great experience which  definitely helped me to achieve my career and professional goals. The program  is an excellent learning experience and a unique opportunity to expose students  to what we do as an agency. Experiences like being in the field with NRCS  professionals, utilization of technology, participation in training and  conferences, and the flexibility of this agency were determinant in the  positive impact that SCEP had on my career. I started my career through this  program and I have continued promoting this opportunity everywhere I have  worked and lived (Puerto Rico, Nebraska,  California, Oregon,  and Michigan)  because it is a unique recruitment and retention method.</p></div>
