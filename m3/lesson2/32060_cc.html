<div id="poptext">
<p>Hi,  my name is Phuong Ly from California.  After I graduated from California State Polytechnic University of Pomona, I was  fortunate to be hired  into the NRCS Career Intern Program.  I'm currently at the end of my two-year FCIP  as a soil conservationist.</p>
<p>FCIP  is a wonderful program because it provides a variety of training to help me  transition to a permanent position with the agency.  As part of the FCIP, the Employee Development  Plan (or EDP) describes the skills and abilities necessary for doing the job.  The EDP includes certain trainings that I'm required to take, such as New  Employee Orientation which sets the basic NRCS background and foundation. Also,  the EDP has been modified to include trainings that are to my interests or that  help me do a better job.</p>
<p>Another great thing about the FCIP program is that  every six months there is an evaluation form to fill out from Human Resources  (HR).  The evaluation form is a great  tool to identify how I am doing and for providing feedback for future  FCIPs.  Besides the biannual report, an  assigned mentor was given to me to provide additional assistance to guide me in  the right direction for the agency.</p> </div>
