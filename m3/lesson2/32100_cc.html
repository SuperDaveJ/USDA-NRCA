<p class="popupTitle">1890 Scholars Employee</p>
<div id="poptext">
<p>I'm  Drenda Williams and I am the Assistant State Conservationist for Operations in Missouri.  I was hired through the 1890 Scholarship  program and had the opportunity of being accepted as one of the first group of  student in 1993 when the program was established.  I learned about the program after my  counselor was given the information by an Agriculture professor from my  hometown who worked at an 1890 school.   Because I came from a rural school of approximately 250 high school  students, networking and word of mouth advertisements about the program are  very crucial.  After I was selected as a  scholar and wanted to major in computer information systems, the NRCS served  as my sponsoring agency. </p>
<p>One  of the benefits of the program is that it provides an exceptional professional  experience for the scholars.  Not only  did it provide financial assistance for 4 years of college, but  it also  allowed me to work as an intern during the summer months as well as during the  school year.  I worked in approximately 6  field offices as a Soil Conservationist trainee prior to graduating, and  performed services in the areas of conservation planning, Geographic  Information Systems, surveying, database management, and practice  compliance.  And while I was an intern,  the hours I worked counted toward years of service after I was converted to a  permanent employee.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for the 1890 program and the  opportunities it has afforded me as an NRCS employee.  I have been able to progress professionally  to a manager level and look to be a State Conservationist in the future.  As a former 1890 scholar, I have also charged  myself to be a marketing tool and example of the benefits of the program and  look forward to its continuation to develop numerous conservation professionals  for years to come. </p></div>
