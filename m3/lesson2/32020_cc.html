<p class="popupTitle">STEP Employee</p>
<div id="poptext"><p>Hi! My name is Andy  McCartney. I’m a student at the University of Michigan--Go Blue!--and I was  lucky enough to be hired as a STEP intern at the NRCS. This program has offered  me several opportunities that will be invaluable as I go forward with my  academic and professional career. For starters, it’s a chance to experience a  real-world office environment without being confined to a copy room.  I have the opportunity to work on numerous  projects reflecting both organizational policies, and operations. Being  directly involved gives me a better understanding of the goals here at the  NRCS, and allows me to see where my contribution plays a part in the success of  its mission. Simply the ability to use some of my skills outside of an academic  arena, the chance to see how they translate into the professional world, has  been a boon to my self-confidence and given me more options for my future  planning.</p>
<p>The most rewarding part of STEP—even more so than  the paycheck—is the chance to operate in a professional work environment with  colleagues who are not only willing to pass along valuable knowledge about the  agency, but about their own professional experiences. These lessons are a great  source of information for a student like me; they reflect a vast amount of  institutional experience that I can take with me going forward, and I’m grateful  for the opportunity.</p></div>
