<div id="poptext"><p>I bet you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;Wow, there&rsquo;s a lot I need to know  about the rules for veterans&rsquo; hiring authorities, especially if this is just  the first of three!&rdquo;  <br />
There are a lot of guidelines associated with veterans&rsquo;  hiring authorities, but keep in mind that this training is not designed to make  you an expert.  These overviews are to  give you a general idea of what&rsquo;s out there so you can talk intelligently to  your potential applicants.</p>
  <p>You can come back to this training to refresh yourself  before you go to an event, and there are links to more information in the  Resources section of the course.  Also,  the hiring officials that go with you to recruiting events are a great source  for answering complex questions about this topic.  Don&rsquo;t be afraid to refer people who need  details about these authorities to HR or to the OPM website!</p></div>
