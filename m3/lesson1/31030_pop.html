NRCS provides funds for supporting those employees to the ACES partner through task agreements.  NRCS conducts interviews and recommends candidates to the program.</p><p> As a recruiter, you may refer potential applicants to an ACES partner website, where such positions are posted.

WAE employees work an intermittent schedule, and hours may vary from week to week; employees are limited to 180 working days per year.  Not-to-exceed (NTE) dates are assigned to each appointment, generally for a six-month interval, and expire automatically unless it is terminated early or extended.  Agencies make and extend temporary limited appointments without prior approval by OPM, and appointments may be extended indefinitely.  Employees on intermittent appointments do not earn leave, receive holiday pay, or contribute to retirement, and are not eligible for health and life insurance.</p>";
