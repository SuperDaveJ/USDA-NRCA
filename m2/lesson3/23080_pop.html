You'll learn more about these benefits in Module 4.<p></p>It's important to understand what benefits exist, but it's most important during recruiting to talk to the candidate about the benefits that are important to that person.  For instance, if you find out during your discussion with a candidate that he likes to travel, emphasize the many NRCS job locations available and that he would have opportunities to move to various locations through a career with the agency.  Likewise, if you discover that a candidate is interested in the flexibility of work-from-home options, discuss the fact that NRCS has a variety of flex schedules and telework options that might be available to her.</p>";
