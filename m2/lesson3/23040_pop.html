It will help you promote the agency effectively - tailoring the information you share with a potential applicant, such as Federal benefits, the work environment, and the mission of conservation.  Keep in mind these questions are not screening questions, as in an interview, but instead designed to give you general information about the person so you can better present the opportunities at NRCS.</p>";

Also, respect the candidate's curiosity—candidates with appropriate skills may not always have experience in the area of conservation or with a specific position at NRCS.<p></p>Be helpful and encouraging, and avoid sounding condescending when a candidate is not familiar with a term or process.  Remember that even if the person with whom you are speaking is not a candidate, they may know someone who is.</p>"

Know what responsibilities the job positions entail, and what qualifications a candidate must possess to be considered for the position.<p></p>To move a candidate from someone who's interested to someone who's ready to apply, you also need to be knowledgeable about what hiring authorities and programs are available, and how an individual might use these programs as options for employment.  You'll learn more about hiring authorities in Module 3.</p>"
