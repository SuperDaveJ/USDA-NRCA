<p>Congratulations!  Now you can  successfully attend a recruiting event or effort.  You know how to effectively promote NRCS,  building credibility through your representation.  You know what to do when talking with  potential applicants and how to present the agency in a realistic yet positive  light.  You also learned tips for how to  properly conduct an on-site interview.   And finally, you learned the appropriate actions to take following a  recruiting event or effort. </p>
<p>The next module, Module 3, will enable you to speak intelligently to  candidates about how NRCS hires its employees—the legal authorities through  which all Federal employees are hired. </p>

  <p ><strong>Representing Yourself and the Agency</strong></p>
  <div id="para1" style="display:none">
    <p><u>Building  Credibility</u><br />
      Establishing  the credibility of the NRCS is your first goal at a recruiting event.  The NRCS needs to be seen as an opportunity  to contribute to society and the environment in a very direct way.  Credibility is created by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Making  positive initial impressions</li>
      <li>Talking  with the candidates</li>
      <li>Ask  discovery questions</li>
      <li>Focus  on the mission of NRCS specifically</li>
      <li>Present  information clearly and appropriately</li>
      <li>Discuss  positions and job titles knowledgably</li>
      <li>Knowing  how to say, &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Know&rdquo;</li>
      </ul>
    <p><u>Managing  Expectations</u><br />
NRCS  candidates need to have a realistic understanding of the nature of our work and  how they would contribute to the NRCS, before they apply.  You can manage these expectations during  recruiting by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being  realistic and positive about the work we do</li>
      <li>Describing  benefits of working at NRCS, relative to the candidate</li>
      <li>Informing  the candidate about applying through USAJobs.gov</li>
      <li>Avoiding  negative discussions about NRCS or other agencies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Highlighting  the benefits of the agency and, most importantly, how a potential applicant can  positively contribute to the NRCS are the best ways to promote the agency.  </p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Informing Participants About Applying</strong></p>
   <div id="para2" style="display:none">
     <p>If  you are asked questions about the application process that you are not prepared  to answer, you should refer applicants to the NRCS Human Resources department  in your state.  Be sure to familiarize  yourself with the application process for available positions as much as  possible.  Make sure you know: </p>
     <ul>
       <li>What  the candidate should do to apply</li>
       <li>What  the position requirements are</li>
       <li>What  documents need to be included with the application</li>
       <li>Contact  information for who the candidate should speak to about questions</li>
       <li>Where  the candidate should send his or her application and required documents</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Detailed  information on applying at USAJobs.gov can be found at: <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/infocenter/">http://www.usajobs.gov/infocenter</a></p>

  <p><strong>Interviewing Techniques and Procedures</strong></p>
   <div id="para3" style="display:none">
  <p><u>Interviewing  When Recruiting</u><br />
If  you anticipate interviewing during a recruiting event, you should make sure  that an HR representative is on your team.   This will help ensure you have a resource on hand to clarify any  hiring-specific questions.<br />
If  you conduct interviews at a recruiting event it’s important to prepare specifically  for that function.  And, since it’s  specifically regulated, know the do’s and don’ts when conducting interviews.</p>
  <p><u>Interviewing  Do’s</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure  consistency by asking the same questions to all candidates</li>
    <li>Make  sure to use the same forms for each applicant</li>
    <li>Ask  job-related questions aimed at eliciting an applicant’s qualifications</li>
  </ul>
  <p><u>Interview  Don’ts</u></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask  illegal questions</li>
    <li>Emphasize  negative aspects of a position</li>
    <li>Discourage  the applicant from applying</li>
    <li>Speculate  on an applicant’s chances of being hired</li>
  </ul>
  <p><u>Conducting  the Interview</u><br />
    Interviews  are conducted in four phases.  You need  to be familiar with and practice each of the phases, which are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opening</li>
    <li>Asking  the interview questions</li>
    <li>Providing  information</li>
    <li>Closing</li>
  </ul>
   </div>
  <p><strong>After a Recruiting Event</strong></p>
   <div id="para4" style="display:none">
   <p>You  should assess the success and appropriateness of the event by evaluating:  </p>
   <ul>
     <li>Were  you able to reach and recruit the types of candidates you intended?</li>
     <li>Was  the event cost-effective?</li>
     <li>Would  you participate in this event or effort in the future?</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Then,  follow up with the official or department from whom you received the  authorization to attend.</p>
   <p>Ensure any resumes and interview information you  collected are properly filed with Human Resources, and follow up with  candidates as appropriate. </p>
