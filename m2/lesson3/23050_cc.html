  <p>If you don’t know the answer to a candidate’s question, and are not sure  where to refer them, offer them your business card so they can follow-up with  you about their question after the event.   When doing so, explain to the candidate that you’d be happy to help them  further if they will email or call you about their question in the next few  days.  Tell them that, this way, you can  be sure that their question will be in front of you when you have the resources  available to address it. </p>
  <p>Addressing  candidate questions in this manner ensures that you don’t set a negative  impression of the agency by promising to follow-up and then inadvertently  forgetting. </p>
