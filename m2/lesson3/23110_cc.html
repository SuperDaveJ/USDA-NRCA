<p class="popupTitle">Student Candidate</p>
  <p>I’ll graduate this year  with a Master’s degree in Natural Resources Management. I see lots of demand  for talent in the field of environmental conservation and that’s where I want  to pursue a career. Why would I want to work for NRCS over another agency like  EPA or Interior, or even private industry?</p>

<p class="popupTitle">NRCS Recruiter</p>

  <p>Can you tell me a little bit about why you worked  toward your degree in Natural Resources Management in the first place? What  interested you about the field?</p>

<p class="popupTitle">Student Candidate</p>

  <p>I’ve always been concerned  about what we’re doing to the environment. Helping manage our natural resources  is something I can do that will make a difference for our kids.</p>

<p class="popupTitle">NRCS Recruiter</p>
  <p>It sounds like you want to do something to  make the world a better place. In that case, there’s nowhere better to have a  satisfying career than in the Federal government. </p>
  <p>Specifically at NRCS we offer challenging work  that really pays off in impact on conservation practices that affect the  environment. You’d have opportunities to develop your skills in an environment  with a great deal of stability. We’re well known for having dedicated and  talented people—people like you, who are committed to the conservation and  preservation of our country’s natural resources. </p>
  <p>We have three regions which include all 50  states, as well as territories in the Caribbean  and Pacific. That means you could do real hands-on work in a variety of places.  You would help farmers and ranchers, or communities in general, conserve soil,  protect wildlife, restore water quality, or implement other measures to  conserve the Nation’s natural resources for future generations. </p>
  <p>You’d use your interpersonal skills to interact  daily with people and encourage them to participate in conservation. At the end  of the day you would be able to actually see the benefit of your work in the  community where you serve.</p>
  <p class="popupTitle">Student Candidate</p>

  <p>With private industry I  could still work in the field and visit a lot of places, and wouldn’t I get a  lot more perks?</p>

<p class="popupTitle">NRCS Recruiter</p>

  <p>The Government offers very competitive perks.  We have flexible work schedules and programs to help employees balance the  demands of work with personal and family responsibilities. The Government  offers training, great benefits, and hiring incentives that compete with any  company. </p>
  <p>Private industry may offer you a bit more money or  some flashy incentives to start, but for the long term, you can’t beat  government work. That’s why most of our people stay with us for so long.</p>
