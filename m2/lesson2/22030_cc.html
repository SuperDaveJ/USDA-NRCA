  <p>Here are a couple more thoughts for you regarding  getting approval and selecting your team.   You may be considered the recruitment representative on the team, but  you may also have HR or field expertise to bring to the table.  If you serve both roles, don’t overextend  your budget or make the team too large by including more people than  necessary. </p>
  <p>Also, when planning the budget and paying for  the event, don’t forget to include travel expenses and arrangements.</p>
